 * mod_count_memcookie.c - User Access Counter with Cookies and the Memcached
 */

====================================================================
* Introduction
====================================================================

mod_count_memcookie is Apache module to provide a counter with
cookies to see how many times a user visited a site in a certain
period of time.

The couter is stored in memcached, and the user's cookie string is
used as the key to identify the user's counter. Every time the user
hit the site, the user's counter is retrieved from memcached by
specifying the user cookie string, and is stored back again after
the counter is incremented. If the counter does not exist in memcached,
then the counter is initialized to 1.

As one of prerequisites of mod_count_memcookie, it needs to be used
in conjunction with a cookie creating module, such as mod_usertrack,
or some other substitution applications since it uses the user's
cookie string for the identification of the user and its' counter
value stored in memcached.

On the plus side, it allows more than one Apache server to share
the same cached data, thus fits very much in scale-out architecture
system. In addtion, the counter info can be applied for simple spam
proxy server by, for example, blocking the user with over the
counter limit of the site.

====================================================================
* Prerequisites
====================================================================

o libevent - used by memcached
  http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

o memcached - used as serssion and count storage.
  In case of mod_count_memcookie-2.0.0 or up, memcached-1.4.0 or up,
  which implements binary protocol, must be used
  http://memcached.org/

o libmemcached - used as memcached c client library
 http://libmemcached.org/libMemcached.html
 needed to compile mod_count_memcookie-2.0.0 or up
 use libmemcached-0.38 or up for mod_count_memcookie-2.0.1 or up

[note]
  from mod_count_memcookie-2.0.0 or up, no longer use libmemcache to compile.
  old version, mod_count_memcookie-1.X use libmemcache.

====================================================================
* Build and Install
====================================================================

1) extract files from an archive
tar zxf modcountmemcookie-<VERSION>.tar.gz
cd modcountmemcookie-<VERSION>

2) open Makefile and modify ap_basedir variable
vi Makefile
 ap_basedir=/PATH-TO-APACHE-BASE

3) make and install
make
sudo make install


====================================================================
* Configuration Directives
====================================================================

All the directives below may be specified in anywhere like Server,
VirtualHost, Location, and so on.

o CountMemCookieEnabled

    Description: set "On" to enable the module, "Off" to disable.
    Syntax: CountMemCookieEnabled On/Off
    Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
    Status: Extension
    Module: mod_count_memcookie

o CountMemCookieName

    Description: set the name of cookie to be used for user's identification.
    Syntax: CountMemCookieName cookieName
    Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
    Status: Extension
    Module: mod_count_memcookie

o CountMemCookieMemcachedAddrPort

    Description: Liste of the memcached address. each address is ip or host
            adresse(s) and port ':' separated. The addresses are ',' coma separated.
            For example:
            192.168.1.1:11211,192.168.1.2:11211
    Syntax: CountMemCookieMemcachedAddrPort host1:port1,host2:port2,..
    Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
    Status: Extension
    Module: mod_count_memcookie


o CountMemCookieMemcachedObjectExpiry

    Description: set the expiry time of session object in memcached in seconds
    Syntax: CountMemCookieMemcachedObjectExpiry  number(second)
    Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
    Status: Extension
    Module: mod_count_memcookie


o CountMemCookieMemcachedTableSize  [DEPRECATED with version 2.0.0 or up]

    Description: set max number of element in session table of memcached.
            0 by default, no limit.
            [warning] this directive is deprecated in mod_count_memcookie-2.0.0.
    Syntax: CountMemCookieMemcachedTableSize number
    Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
    Status: Extension
    Module: mod_count_memcookie


o CountMemCookieSetHTTPHeader

    Description: Set to "On" to set count information to http header. "Off" by default
    Syntax: CountMemCookieSetHTTPHeader On/Off
    Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
    Status: Extension
    Module: mod_count_memcookie


====================================================================
* Sample Configuration
====================================================================

1) load module
LoadModule count_memcookie_module modules/mod_count_memcookie.so

2) add directives below
CountMemCookieEnabled on
CountMemCookieName  Apache
CountMemCookieMemcachedAddrPort  127.0.0.1:11211
CountMemCookieMemcachedObjectExpiry 1000
CountMemCookieSetHTTPHeader on

see also: sample_mod_count_memcookie.conf


[note]
As described in "Introduction" secion above, mod_count_memcookie 
needs to be used in conjunction with a cookie creating module, 
such as mod_usertrack, or some other substitution applications 
since it uses the user's cookie string for the identification 
of the user and its' counter value stored in memcached.

Here is an example configuration for mod_usertrack:

LoadModule usertrack_module modules/mod_usertrack.so
CookieTracking on
CookieName Apache
CookieExpires "1 months"

see also: sample_mod_usertrack.conf


====================================================================
* Logging Counter Info
====================================================================

By setting CountMemCookieSetHTTPHeader directive to "On", the counter
nfo is added to http header table with the key named "count_memcookie".
Therefore, you can add the counter info to the "CustomLog" by adding
the %{count_memcookie}i string to log format string of CustomLog directive.

ex.
CustomLog logs/clicklog "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\" \"%{count_memcookie}i\"


====================================================================
* Application Sample
====================================================================

mod_count_memcookie adds the counter info to apache subprocess_env
table with the key named "count_memcookie". Therefore, the counter
info can be applied for scripts language like this below:

o php
<?php
 $count = getenv ( "count_memcookie" );
?>

o perl
#! /usr/bin/perl
my $count = $ENV{ "count_memcookie" };
